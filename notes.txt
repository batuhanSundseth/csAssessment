Each function scales with the size of the array passed to it. The larger the array, the slower the runtime.
The append function scales better than the insert function because it has a faster runtime when it is given larger array sizes than the insert function. The runtime of the insert function increases at a faster rate than the append function as array sizes get larger, whihc makes it have worse scaling.

The .push function simply appends a value to the end of an array, while .unshift must shift the index of every value in the array and add a new value at index 0.
